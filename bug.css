The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this example, we might expect the `.parent .child` selector to override the `.child` selector due to its higher specificity. However, the `!important` declaration in `.child` overrides even the more specific selector.

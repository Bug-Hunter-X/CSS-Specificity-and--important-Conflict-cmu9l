The solution lies in refactoring the CSS to avoid using `!important`:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

/* Or use a more specific selector if needed */
.parent .child.specific {
  color: purple;
}
```

By removing `!important` and utilizing more specific selectors, we ensure that CSS rules are applied predictably and consistently based on specificity, making the code easier to maintain and debug.
